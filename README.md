# 📌 Unit Converter App

## **Introduction**
Welcome to the **Unit Converter App**, a simple yet professional tool built using **Streamlit** in Python.  
This project is designed to help students and developers understand the **best practices** of writing **clean, structured, and well-documented code**.  

As a **Final Year BS Software Engineering Student**, I have implemented this project with a focus on:
- Writing **efficient and modular code**.
- Using **lambda functions** and **conversion logic** effectively.
- Implementing a **professional UI** with **Streamlit**.
- Ensuring the app is **user-friendly** and **error-free**.

Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced coder, this app will help you understand **unit conversions** while following **best coding practices**.
